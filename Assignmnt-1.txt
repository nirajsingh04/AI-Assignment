Problem :- Write an Algorithm for Monk-Tiger-Goat-Cabbage problem (condition is that boat can carry only 2 items at a time.)

Solution :- Algorithm for the peoblem statement is as follows-
            Step 1- Monk will take goat with him across the river.
            step 2- Come back to the initial side of the river and this time he will take Tiger with him across
                    the river.
            step 3- Again Monk will come to the initial side of the river but not alone this time he must take 
                    goat with him back to the initial side of the river and leave tiger alone to the other side
                    of the river.
            step 4- This time he will take cabbage with him to the other side of the river leaving goat to the
                    initial side of the river.
            step 5- Again he will come back to the initial side of the river alone leaving tiger and cabbage to
                    the other side.
            step 6- Now, only goat is left to the initial side of the river which he will take with him this time.

            Now Monk, Tiger, Goat, Cabbage all are at the other side of the river.
